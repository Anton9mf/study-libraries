      "IPython -- An enhanced Interactive Python\n",
      "=========================================\n",
      "\n",
      "IPython offers a fully compatible replacement for the standard Python\n",
      "interpreter, with convenient shell features, special commands, command\n",
      "history mechanism and output results caching.\n",
      "\n",
      "At your system command line, type 'ipython -h' to see the command line\n",
      "options available. This document only describes interactive features.\n",
      "\n",
      "GETTING HELP\n",
      "------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Within IPython you have various way to access help:\n",
      "\n",
      "  ?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features (this screen).\n",
      "  object?   -> Details about 'object'.\n",
      "  object??  -> More detailed, verbose information about 'object'.\n",
      "  %quickref -> Quick reference of all IPython specific syntax and magics.\n",

      "-------------\n",
      "\n",
      "* Access to the standard Python help with object docstrings and the Python\n",
      "  manuals. Simply type 'help' (no quotes) to invoke it.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Magic commands: type %magic for information on the magic subsystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "* System command aliases, via the %alias command or the configuration file(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Dynamic object information:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Typing ?word or word? prints detailed information about an object. Certain\n",
      "  long strings (code, etc.) get snipped in the center for brevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Typing ??word or word?? gives access to the full information without\n",
      "  snipping long strings. Strings that are longer than the screen are printed\n",
      "  through the less pager.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The ?/?? system gives access to the full source code for any object (if\n",
      "  available), shows function prototypes and other useful information.\n",
      "\n",
      "  If you just want to see an object's docstring, type '%pdoc object' (without\n",
      "  quotes, and without % if you have automagic on).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Tab completion in the local namespace:\n",
      "\n",
      "  At any time, hitting tab will complete any available python commands or\n",
      "  variable names, and show you a list of the possible completions if there's\n",
      "  no unambiguous one. It will also complete filenames in the current directory.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Search previous command history in multiple ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "  - Start typing, and then use arrow keys up/down or (Ctrl-p/Ctrl-n) to search\n",
      "    through the history items that match what you've typed so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - Hit Ctrl-r: opens a search prompt. Begin typing and the system searches\n",
      "    your history for lines that match what you've typed so far, completing as\n",
      "    much as it can.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - %hist: search history by index.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Persistent command history across sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Logging of input with the ability to save and restore a working session.\n",
      "\n",
      "* System shell with !. Typing !ls will run 'ls' in the current directory.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The reload command does a 'deep' reload of a module: changes made to the\n",
      "  module since you imported will actually be available without having to exit.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Verbose and colored exception traceback printouts. See the magic xmode and\n",
      "  xcolor functions for details (just type %magic).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Input caching system:\n",
      "\n",
      "  IPython offers numbered prompts (In/Out) with input and output caching. All\n",
      "  input is saved and can be retrieved as variables (besides the usual arrow\n",
      "  key recall).\n",
      "\n",
      "  The following GLOBAL variables always exist (so don't overwrite them!):\n",
      "  _i: stores previous input.\n",
      "  _ii: next previous.\n",
      "  _iii: next-next previous.\n",
      "  _ih : a list of all input _ih[n] is the input from line n.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Additionally, global variables named _i<n> are dynamically created (<n>\n",
      "  being the prompt counter), such that _i<n> == _ih[<n>]\n",
      "\n",
      "  For example, what you typed at prompt 14 is available as _i14 and _ih[14].\n",
      "\n",
      "  You can create macros which contain multiple input lines from this history,\n",
      "  for later re-execution, with the %macro function.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The history function %hist allows you to see any part of your input history\n",
      "  by printing a range of the _i variables. Note that inputs which contain\n",
      "  magic functions (%) appear in the history with a prepended comment. This is\n",
      "  because they aren't really valid Python code, so you can't exec them.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Output caching system:\n",
      "\n",
      "  For output that is returned from actions, a system similar to the input\n",
      "  cache exists but using _ instead of _i. Only actions that produce a result\n",
      "  (NOT assignments, for example) are cached. If you are familiar with\n",
      "  Mathematica, IPython's _ variables behave exactly like Mathematica's %\n",
      "  variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The following GLOBAL variables always exist (so don't overwrite them!):\n",
      "  _ (one underscore): previous output.\n",
      "  __ (two underscores): next previous.\n",
      "  ___ (three underscores): next-next previous.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Global variables named _<n> are dynamically created (<n> being the prompt\n",
      "  counter), such that the result of output <n> is always available as _<n>.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Finally, a global dictionary named _oh exists with entries for all lines\n",
      "  which generated output.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Directory history:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Your history of visited directories is kept in the global list _dh, and the\n",
      "  magic %cd command can be used to go to any entry in that list.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Auto-parentheses and auto-quotes (adapted from Nathan Gray's LazyPython)\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. Auto-parentheses\n",
      "        \n",
      "     Callable objects (i.e. functions, methods, etc) can be invoked like\n",

      "       \n",
      "     This feature is off by default (in rare cases it can produce\n",
      "     undesirable side-effects), but you can activate it at the command-line\n",
      "     by starting IPython with `--autocall 1`, set it permanently in your\n",
      "     configuration file, or turn on at runtime with `%autocall 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "     You can force auto-parentheses by using '/' as the first character\n",

      "       \n",
      "          In [1]: /globals             # becomes 'globals()'\n",
